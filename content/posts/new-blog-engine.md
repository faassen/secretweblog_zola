My blog used to use the venerable
[newsbruiser](http://newsbruiser.tigris.org/) system. It worked, and has
a nice web UI, but looked ugly. Now I could've fixed that, but since I
wanted to change my blog workflow anyway to something filesytem and
version control based, I've switched to a static blog generator instead:
[Nikola](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/). Thank you newsbruiser, you did
well for me!

This was a fun little project: it involved taking the restructured text
content from newsbruiser and generating restructured text content that
Nikola could deal with, configuring Nikola, digging out the comments
from newsbruiser and putting them into [disqus](http://disqus.com) (I
hope I got out most of them), and all the little conversion issues
surrounding it.

I've retitled my blog from "Python Secret Weblog" to just "Secret
Weblog" to reflect my increasing focus on JavaScript code too. I still
love Python, though, so I will be writing more Python-related content as
well.

The blog's URL changed too: it's now at <http://blog.startifact.com> instead.
I've put redirects in place on the old <http://faassen.n--tree.net/blog>
location to preserve links to the old articles. [2024 note: those redirects are
long broken, but I've fixed internal links in the old posts at last]

I also hope that with this refresh I'll start blogging a bit more often!

Welcome to my new blog!
