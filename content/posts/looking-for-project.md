I'm looking for a project to inspire me! I'm a creative developer with
15 years experience doing Python and the web. So much experience doing
web applications does not mean I'm stuck in the past; I'm an
accomplished client-side JavaScript developer too (who created a
[client-side web framework](http://obviel.org)).

You can check out <http://startifact.com> for an overview of some of the
stuff I've done.

If you're interested in hiring me to help you improve your project or
create something new, please contact me at <faassen@startifact.com>

I hope to hear from you!
