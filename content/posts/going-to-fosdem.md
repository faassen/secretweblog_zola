This weekend I'm off to FOSDEM, a large free software/open source event
in Brussels. For years I intended to go but for years I didn't make it.
But this weekend I'll be there, taking the train later today!

This year there unfortunately seem to be precious few Python (or Zope,
or Plone) related events at FOSDEM. Lots of other languages and web
frameworks are there, so what's wrong with us? If this FOSDEM is a
success, perhaps next year I can help organize some of those.

If you're going to be there and you'd like to say "Hi", please drop me
an email (faassen at startifact.com) and we can see whether we can
arrange to meet!
