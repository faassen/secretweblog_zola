# Titus Brown on the importance of communication

I just read an [insightful article by Titus
Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/dec-09/aggressive-competence) about
the importance of communication in a team project, in the context of
open source projects. It is a very good articulation of a topic I've
thought about a lot myself as well.

When helping to manage Zope's participation in the Google Summer of Code
I recognized the problems that Titus is talking about. One thing I told
students in advance is simply [to make
noise](https://mail.zope.org/pipermail/gsoc/2007-May/000048.html)

That did have a positive effect. Still, the next year I started to
explicitly require all participating students to give regular updates,
just like what Titus is planning.

Without regular updates, it's far too easy for time (days, weeks,
months) to pass by without obvious progress. Sometimes that is because
the progress is hidden. Sometimes that is because the progress itself is
in fact lacking: nobody knows you're blocked if you don't tell people
about it.

Unfortunately even with those guidelines in place, it turns out to be
difficult to make people communicate... Requiring regular reports helped
me catch some potential problems early, but even raising my problem
didn't always help to make the problem actually go away...

In part that's probably due to shyness or lack of confidence on the part
of these people. When you communicate a lot, you may in fact end up
saying things that aren't too smart once every while, and people
probably worry overly much about that. Feedback can help you learn, and
can only get feedback if people know you're there in the first place.

In part it's just due to differences in personality: not everybody
communicates in the same way. That's fine - there are many ways to make
a positive contribution, as long as you show what you're up to.

Sometimes too there is too much chatter and you just want to hunker down
and get work done without distractions. It's just important to remember
to resurface once every while.

On the other hand, communication can also be a great way to keep
yourself motivated and productive. Sometimes it is quite comfortable to
let time go by and slack off, and then it is nice nobody worries about
your progress...

I'll just quoting myself again about noise (through
[Reinout](http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2009/12/03/quotes.html)):

> I’m a natural noise-maker, and I discovered that while as a result of
> this I embarrass myself in public on a regular basis, it also means a
> lot of people know who I am. That’s a good thing.

And this, which I cannot even remember saying (through [Michael
Hudson](http://python.net/~mwh/quotes.html)):

> faassen: anyway, if nothing else flapping your arms running around  
> will at least give an impression of activity. :)

Since this is a somewhat self-absorbed post anyway, quoting myself and
all that, let me finish with a story about my early involvement in the
Python community that I think is relevant to this discussion.

The comp.lang.python newsgroup when I joined it sometime in late 1998
was a small and friendly place. Thinking back it seems I spent most of
my time posting very silly posts about the Python Secret Underground
(PSU), an organization about which, naturally, I cannot say anything
more. It was a lot of fun but perhaps not the most constructive
contribution to the Python community.

I first went to an international Python conference in in the US in the
year 2000. It didn't seem odd to me then, but afterwards I realized that
many people there who I had never met before knew who I was. I also knew
who many of them were. I think the silly interactions about the PSU that
I was involved in on comp.lang.python explain a lot of that. It was
completely unintentional, but today I still benefit from the connections
I made then.

So, contribute to an open source community! Communicate! Communicate by
creating code, writing documentation, or perhaps just by making people
chuckle. Communication makes you more engaged in the project, and more
motivated to contribute, and more creative and productive as a result.
You may also be pleasantly surprised by the feedback.
