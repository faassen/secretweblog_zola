# Credit where credit's due

Thank you Phillip Eby for giving credit where's credit's due in your
comment on this
[article](http://www.groovie.org/articles/2005/09/30/best-of-breed-controllers-for-mvc-web-frameworks).

Zope's ancestor Bobo could do something almost a decade ago that's
getting popular now: object publishing. Jim Fulton deserves a lot of
credit for that. This also makes me wonder whether there are things in
Zope 3 that will become popular about a decade from now... Perhaps some
people would like to join us to help find out?

I also think Jim and Paul deserve credit for helping to turn Phillip Eby
into a python programmer.
