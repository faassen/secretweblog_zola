Zope at its birth in 1998 was neither a content management system nor a
web framework. Zope was born too early; before we understood either very
well.

Zope was like a futuristic space alien from another dimension. In many
ways it was advanced far beyond its time. It was _weird_. Some of its
weird ideas didn't work out, but there are also ideas in there that are
worthy of further consideration even today. Some of its innovations were
weird at the time but have now become the new normal.

Zope during its early days was big news, with a big community and a big
codebase. It had been a commercial product at first, and then was open
sourced by its creators -- a move that seems unremarkable now, but was
so unprecedented at the time it gained wide-spread media attention.

One of its then-weird ideas that turned out to be a good idea was to
write Zope in Python. Python at the time was still an obscure
programming language. Zope was enormously influential on the Python
community. Zope pushed the Python language beyond where it had been
pushed before. People flocked to Zope, and some went on to Python. Zope
caused the attendance of Python conferences to swell. In Europe, the
EuroPython series of conferences was kicked off, in part, by people who
used Zope.

This caused some friction, to be sure. Even today, many years later,
passions can still be raised by Zope among Python developers. The Python
language community puts an emphasis on clarity, and Zope was using
Python in strange new ways, not always clear or clean.
