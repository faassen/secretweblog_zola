I'm happy to announce the release of Five 0.3 today, the Zope 3 in Zope
2 integration component. This release has great new features, including
edit forms and add forms based on Zope 3 schemas. See [the Five
website](http://codespeak.net/z3/five/) for more information, and in
particular the [CHANGES](http://codespeak.net/z3/five/CHANGES.html).

Thanks to all the Five developers who made this release possible!
