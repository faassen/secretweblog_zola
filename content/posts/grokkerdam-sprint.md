# Grokkerdam sprint!

It was planned for a long time, but at last we are going to hold a
[Grok](http://grok.zope.org) sprint in the Netherlands. To be more
precise, in Rotterdam. Rotterdam will be "Grokkerdam" for the duration
of the sprint!

**Where**: Rotterdam, the Netherlands

**When**: 30 april - 5 may 2008

**Who**: hopefully, you!

A number of experienced Grokkers will be attending. People of all
experience levels are welcome, as long as you're interested in helping
us improve Grok. Tasks could be anything Grok related. Some possible
topics:

- improving the Grok introspector UI
- relational database integration for Grok
- Polishing Grok's KSS integration
- Preparing for Grok's 1.0 release
- Documentation

... or whatever you want to work on!

Sign up for the sprint on our wiki page, here:

If you have any comments or questions, please mail me!

Our generous host for this sprint is The Health Agency
(<http://www.thehealthagency.com/>), a company that uses Grok for its
own web applications here in Rotterdam.

Note: this sprint is back-to-back with the [Plone 3
sprint](http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-3-paris-sprint/project-home)
in Paris (25-27 april), hosted by Ingeniweb. Rotterdam is 3 hours away
from Paris by train. You could participate in both sprints and enjoy a
few days of Paris (or Rotterdam) in between.
