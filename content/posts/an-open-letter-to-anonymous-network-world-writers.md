# An open letter to anonymous Network World writers

Dear anonymous Network World writers claiming to speak for corporate IT
executives,

I read your recent [open
letter](http://www.networkworld.com/supp/2005/opensource/070405-what-users-want.html)
to the open source community with interest. You say that before free
software can take on a higher profile in big IT departments you need to
see the following things from us in the open source community:

- more enterprise-class support
- better documentation
- a sense of stability
- access to more platforms
- a commitment to stay open
- a focus on the end user.

I'm happy to say that the open source community can deliver on all of
these. I presume of course that for the implementation of this wishlist,
you are also willing to pay first. Supporting a healthy ecosystem of
open source companies after all generally works better than slinging
open letters at us. Open letters with wishlists in them feels a bit too
much like looking gift horses in the mouth.

Thank you,

One member of the open source community
