Today the Morepath developers released
[Morepath](http://morepath.readthedocs.io) 0.15
([CHANGES](http://morepath.readthedocs.io/en/0.15/changes.html)).

What is Morepath? Morepath is a Python web framework that is small, easy
to learn, extensively documented, and insanely powerful.

This release is a smaller release without big visible changes, or big
hood changes. Instead it polishes a lot of stuff. It also continues the
trend with contributions from multiple core developers.

This release prepares the way for the *next* Morepath release. To this
end we've deprecated a number of APIs. We are preparing a big change to
the underlying Reg predicate dispatch library APIs that should make it
less implicit, less magic, and make it perform slightly better. Stay
tuned!
