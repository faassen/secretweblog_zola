Paul Everitt asks [Should Zope 3 support
XML?](http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/2005/03/11.html#a303). The answer
is of course, _yes, it should_, and, what's more, _yes it will_, and
[Infrae](http://www.infrae.com) will be one party working on it. In
fact, we've [already worked on it](http://codespeak.net/svn/z3/zopexml).

Paul is right in that many Zope 3 developers, and many Python developers in
general, don't give XML a high priority. I wrote about some of the possible
attitudes surrounding this
[before](@/posts/about-the-disdain-for-xml-among-python-programmers.md).

I am involved in Zope 3 development, and I care deeply about XML
support, and have been thinking it over for, well, years now. In
[Silva](http://www.infrae.com/products/silva), we have been adding more
XML support with every release, and are going to release [more
soon](http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/2005/02/09.html), so we now have
quite an extensive background in these matters too. We'll be looking
into porting this functionality onto the Zope 3 platform.

Infrae and Nuxeo recently announced that we will be [working
together](http://www.infrae.com/newsitems/InfraeNuxeoCooperation) on
Zope 3 development. XML support will certainly be a part of this
cooperation.

What shape this XML support should take in Zope 3 needs to be debated.
It might be in the core, it might make more sense as an extension. It
might be a combination of both. One way or another, Infrae be helping to
develop it, and our aim will be to make the functionality attractive
enough so that anyone who wants to do serious application development
with Zope 3 will be tempted into using it.
