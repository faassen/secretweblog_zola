# Assuming deceit

People frequently conclude inaccurately that someone who criticizes
their community in some way is not only wrong, but also actively
malicious; a liar, a manipulator, a troll. This faulty conclusion can
lead to a lot of trouble.

I ran into such reasoning again recently, and I thought I'd try to
explain to myself how I think normal human impulses can lead to such
faulty conclusions. In case they prove useful to anyone else, I'll share
my thoughts here.

So let's sketch out how I could react when someone criticizes my
community in some way.

- Someone says something negative about my community. It doesn't have to
  be extremely negative. Perhaps they just say that some people in that
  community are nasty to them, or that there's room for some
  improvement.
- But I like my community! I've had pleasant experiences! This community
  helps define my identity. This hits me hard!
- I don't want to believe these negative things! [Cognitive
  dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) kicks
  in.
- This person must be *wrong*. What they are saying is *false*.
- I need to convince myself and others of this. So I look for evidence.
  Since I've already drawn the conclusion that this person is wrong, I'm
  going to easily convinced by this evidence.
- I just need to find one flaw. I focus on one thing in all the things
  they say. Perhaps it seems implausible to me. Maybe it has no evidence
  to back it up. Or maybe I can find some evidence against it.
- In fact, I don't need to go looking for this flaw myself. Someone else
  in my community probably has found it already. I can just go with
  that.
- I try to focus any discussion concerning this criticism on this one
  flaw I perceive. I ignore all the rest.
- In time my community comes up with a whole list of perceived flaws. I
  focus on these details, not on the whole, and not on those details
  that do seem to be true.
- We should be on guard against manipulators, psychopaths, and trolls!
- Why would someone spread such falsehoods?
- These flaws are evidence of their deliberate attack on my community!
- I conclude that this person is *lying* to maliciously attack my
  community! Or they are lying to garner sympathy! Or both!

Most of us want to be in a community, we want to preserve and defend it,
we want to think well of ourselves and our community, we are on guard
against deception, we want the truth and we are inclined to believe
people in our community before we believe outsiders. It's very human to
go down this path, and people go down it all the time.

But these normal human impulses can lead us to conclude that a
whistleblower or a victim or a constructive critic is lying. We conclude
that this lie is part of a malicious attack. It is often easier to
believe this than to deal with the criticism in another way.

We could instead choose to accept the criticism as partially or
completely valid. We do not have to accept the criticism however: even
when we reject it we could still have a calm discussion about the topic.
We could also conclude that this person has very strange notions without
thinking that they are lying or malicious. But unfortunately it's often
easier to conclude the other person is a liar or a troll.

# Negative consequences

This is obviously a bad outcome for the whistleblower or critic -- and
even worse for a victim. It's also a bad outcome for our community
--this defensive behavior can block growth and improvement.

This is bad enough. If only it ended there. But this defensive reaction
can then give additional reasons to criticize the community, and this
then generates more defensive reactions. A vicious cycle has started.

A community can then build up a convincing list of
[apologetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics) arguments over
time, entrenching it far more in one position than where it was when the
whole thing started. The reactions back and forth can generate a whole
lot more "evidence" that people are indeed viciously attacking the
community. By that stage, there will be *real* vicious attacks if there
weren't already before.

We end up with a lot of people badly hurt, bitter enemies, broken
communities, maybe actual violence.

# Compensate

I think there are a number of things we as individuals can do to
compensate against these human impulses, to prevent us from going down
this path. One useful principle is [Postel's
Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle), adapted from
electronic to human communication:

> Be careful in what you say, be liberal in what you accept from others.

Another useful notion is [Hanlon's
razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor):

> Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by
> stupidity.

I'll give some variations here:

- Treat criticism as intended to be constructive, even when it doesn't
  look constructive to you.
- Before you conclude attack, try context, misinterpretation,
  perspectives, experiences, disagreement, hyperbole, mistake and being
  wrong.
- Don't assume malicious conspiracy. Look for other reasons why people
  would all act in a certain way.
- Assume that the attack isn't one, until the evidence for attack
  becomes vastly overwhelming.
- When faced with criticism, err on the side of the positive
  interpretation.
- When confronted with falsehood, assume a mistake before lying.
- Do not judge a person before you perceive them.
- Consider walking away instead of fighting.
- Your community is strong enough to do without your defense. Your
  community becomes stronger by constructive endeavors.

There is a possible problem with this strategy. Not everyone is
well-intentioned. There are real liars, trolls, manipulators and
psychopaths out there. There are those among us who want to try to fan
the flames for their own amusement. I think being generous to others in
our interpretations can reduce their power to do so. Maybe I'll talk a
bit more about this in the future.
