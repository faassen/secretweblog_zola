Last week I gave a [keynote speech at PyCon
DE](http://pyvideo.org/video/2416/spinning-a-web-framework). It was
about a number of topics, too many topics, in fact (I went over my
allotted time, something I regret). One topic was described by a friend
as me "coming out of the closet" about my exit from Zope.

So let's come out of the closet on my blog too. A few years ago, I
stopped my involvement with Zope. I gave up hope about Zope becoming
more creative again as a web framework, and stopped my futile efforts to
push it in that direction. For me, the days of Zope are over. Leaving
Zope was difficult for me -- I am a passionate software developer and I
had been involved with Zope since its inception as an open source
project in 1998.

In fact, I still use Zope, through Grok, though Grok is now in
maintenance mode as well. I use Zope a lot *conceptually*, when I
approach new problem domains like programming the web browser
([Obviel](http://obviel.org)) or creating a new server-side web
framework ([morepath](https://github.com/morepath/morepath)). The
lessons and patterns I learned from Zope will never go away. Though I
don't work on it anymore, Zope is still on my mind.

In a few \[edit: more than a few!\] upcoming blog entries I will talk a
bit about Zope and my involvement in it. Perhaps it will be of interest
to some.

I will post the entries in this series here:
