I'm happy to announce that the Zope Foundation was accepted by Google as
mentoring organization in the [Google Summer of
Code](http://code.google.com/soc)! This means we're looking for students
and more mentors who would like to take on projects, as well as good
projects. We have a [wiki
page](http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/SummerOfCode2007) about it with project
suggestions and prospective mentors; if you're interested in this
project, please check it out.

If you're an interested student or mentor, please also join our [mailing
list](http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc) and discuss your ideas
here.
