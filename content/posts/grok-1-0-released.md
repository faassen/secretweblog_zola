# Grok 1.0 released!

Grok 1.0 was released today! Almost exactly three years after the first
lines of code were written, and many Grok-based applications later,
we've finally released Grok 1.0.

Grok is a web framework based on the Zope Toolkit. It's based around a
powerful component architecture (zope.component) and a powerful system
for connecting these components (zope.configuration and Grok's own
Martian).

Here is the official release announcement:

And for much more about grok, see <http://grok.zope.org>

We're not stopping here: the Grok development team is already hard at
work at creating many new extensions for Grok, and of course we're now
we're excited about all the new features and improvements we can add to
Grok!
