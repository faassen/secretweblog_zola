This is an _old_ blog by now. I started it in 2005. But I'm not old! No
way!

Over the years I wrote a lot of stuff. Sprinkled throughout are entries
that I think are still relevant. So if you'd like, join me in my little
journey through the history of my secret weblog. Warning: it's mostly
about software development in one way or another.

<!-- more -->

In a few places I will brag about my uncanny ability to invent future
web development trends just in time -- around the same time other people
are more successfully inventing them.

# What is Pythonic?

[What is
Pythonic?](@/posts/what-is-pythonic.md)
from 2005 is one of the earliest entries in my blog, and one of the most
popular ones. It's because it answers a question many who learn Python
will ask: what the heck does "Pythonic?" mean?

# Programming

[Under-engineering, over-engineering,
right-engineering](@/posts/under-engineering-over-engineering-right-engineering.md)
talks about the careful balancing act we have to do as developers:
what's the Goldilocks zone of engineering complexity for a particular
problem?

[Debugging Strategy: easy stuff
first](@/posts/debugging-strategy-easy-stuff-first.md)
gives the following advice: even though the bug can't possibly be caused
by a thing, if that thing is quick and easy to check, check anyway.

[The Story of
None](@/posts/none_01_the_beginning.md) is a
series of posts about how to deal with
<span class="title-ref">None</span>/<span class="title-ref">null</span>/<span class="title-ref">undefined</span>
in software. It touches on guard clauses, validation and normalization.

[Life at the Boundaries: Conversion and
Validation](@/posts/conversion-and-validation.md)
goes into application layering and what we do at the boundaries. A lot
of creative software development is establishing and guarding boundaries
in applications and frameworks.

[Punctuated Equilibrium in
Software](@/posts/punctuated-equilibrium-in-software.md)
is a case study of the conceptual changes that happened over the course
of a few years in one of the software libraries I wrote.

And just recently I wrote [Refactoring to Multiple Exit
Points](@/posts/refactoring-to-multiple-exit-points.md).

# Python 3 transition

Last year (2018), I read an [article on
lwn](https://lwn.net/Articles/750833/) that said the following:

> The switch from Python 2 to 3 is a huge job; one might guess that it
> is orders of magnitude larger than anyone had anticipated back in the
> heady days of Python 3000 (around 2007, say).

Anyone, you say? In 2007, I wrote [Brief Python 3000
thoughts](@/posts/brief-python-3000-thoughts.md).
The Greek myth of [Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra)
resonates with me now. I am glad the end of this transition now appears
to be in sight at last.

I think [the Gravity of Python
2](@/posts/python-2-gravity.md) (from 2014.md)
is the most insightful article of the bunch I wrote on this topic - it
talks about the invisible hands that were holding back Python 3
adoption. I think these forces apply in any widely used foundational
software that breaks compatibility.

# Modern client-side times

In an [otherwise not very relevant
article](@/posts/new-year-s-python-meme.md)
in 2009, I wrote this:

> If I can count techniques I've been trying to pioneer myself:
> Template-driven development where the web browser renders the
> templates. This along with the notion of client-side views can lead to
> surprisingly clean rich client-side apps.

Client-side templates and views are now a huge thing on the web. But
when I wrote the article, Backbone and Angular were almost a year away
still.

In 2011, I wrote about my experiment in 2003, [when I first tried to
build a client-side template
language](@/posts/the-new-hot-thing-in-web-development-client-side-templating-languages.md):

> I told other developers about it, and they all asked "why?". My answer
> was something like "I don't know man, it's just cool!"

(my apologies for the gendered language)

In the article I discuss how client-side frameworks affect the
architecture of web applications.

In [Modern Client-Side
Times](@/posts/modern-client-side-times.md)
I explore what the client-side revolution means for the backend web
framework.

I like writing retrospectives. If you like reading them, you can read my
[Seven Years: A Very Personal History of the
Web](@/posts/seven-years-a-very-personal-history-of-the-web.md),
from 2017.

# Open Source

In [The importance of
communication](@/posts/titus-brown-on-the-importance-of-communication.md)
I tell the tale of how making lots of noise helped me in open source. I
do make a lot of noise. I admit it can be a bit much. But it has also
benefited me and it may benefit you.

I discuss [how to handle
ideas](@/posts/how-to-handle-ideas.md)
when they are offered to an open source project.

In [a massive multi-part
retrospective](@/posts/my-exit-from-zope.md)
on the epic story of the rise and fall of Zope, I describe the evolution
of that ancient web framework and my involvement in it. It's a story
that's Dan Abramov Approved (tm)!

Names are important. I tell you [how not to name
software](@/posts/on-naming-in-open-source.md).

I also explain why I think open source projects [shouldn't have
"contrib"
directories](@/posts/against-contrib.md).

In 2015 I write about the [history of
reselect](@/posts/a-brief-history-of-reselect.md),
a popular JS library I accidentally helped to call into existence.

# Miscellaneous topics

On occasion I've also written about topics on my blog that aren't about
software development.

In 2014's [They say something I don't like so they must be
lying!](@/posts/they-say-something-i-dont-like-so-they-must-be-lying.md)
I observe how human behavior can make communities fight and how to
compensate. The article ends like this:

> Not everyone is well-intentioned. There are real liars, trolls,
> manipulators and psychopaths out there. There are those among us who
> want to try to fan the flames for their own amusement. I think being
> generous to others in our interpretations can reduce their power to do
> so. Maybe I'll talk a bit more about this in the future.

I haven't, yet. But it is, unfortunately, relevant.

Finally, in [The Incredible Drifting
Cyber](@/posts/the-incredible-drifting-cyber.md)
I go into the wild evolution of the prefix
<span class="title-ref">cyber</span>, and how it became unfun.

# Conclusion

And this concludes the tour. I hope you enjoy reading some of my
articles!
