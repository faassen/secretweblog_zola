# To PyCon I Go

I decided to attend PyCon this year; there are a lot of people going
there that I'd like to meet, and a lot of people I'd like to run into
again. Oh, and there are cool talks too!

I'll be there for the duration of the conference itself, and the first
2.5 days of the sprint.

I'll be wearing many hats: my [Startifact](http://startifact.com) hat,
my [Grok](http://grok.zope.org) hat, my [Zope
Foundation](http://foundation.zope.org) chairman hat (we have a new
board, but haven't elected a new chairman yet), my [Zope Framework
Steering Group](http://docs.zope.org/zopeframework/) hat and my [Zea
partners](http://www.zeapartners.org/) hat. And my
Martijn-the-python-programmer hat, if that's a hat. If you want to talk
to me in any of these capacities or any other, please do!
