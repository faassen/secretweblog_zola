# DZUG keynote

I was honoured to be asked to give a keynote talk at the recent DZUG
conference in Sankt Augustin near Bonn, Germany. Even though DZUG is the
German speaking Zope User Group, I was allowed to speak in English. :)
My talk was titled "Zope in Perspective". Christian Scholz was kind
enough to film it, also wrote a [blog

about , and put the video online! This way I could see all my mistakes,
but overall it went well. If you're interested in the history of Zope,
where we are now, and a chuckle or two, you might want to [take a look

Enjoy!
