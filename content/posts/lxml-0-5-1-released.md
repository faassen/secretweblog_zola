# lxml 0.5.1 released

I've just released version 0.5.1 of lxml, the Pythonic binding to the
libxml2 and libxslt libraries. This because I got feedback to 0.5 which
pointed to a critical bug in the way unicode was handled. This kind of
feedback is why I should've released lxml long ago!

lxml 0.5.1, and more information, can be found here:
