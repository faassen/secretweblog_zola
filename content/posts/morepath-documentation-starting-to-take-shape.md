For a while now I've been working on documenting Morepath, the Python
web framework with super powers. There is now a [significant dose of
documentation available](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest).
Perhaps it'll be interesting holiday reading for someone! If not, no
problem: I'll be back next year with more!

Hopefully this will help people get an idea of what Morepath is all
about. I'm very excited about how it's been taking shape!

Let me know what you think!
