This is awesome. There is now a published
[book](https://www.packtpub.com/product/grok-1-0-web-development/9781847197481)
about [Grok](http://grok.zope.org)!

Thank you, Carlos, very much, for writing this book. That was a lot of
work!

Why would you, Python developer, be interested in Grok? Why not learn
about one of the myriad other Python web frameworks instead? Kevin
Teague in a recent [reddit
thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0hhk/grok_10_web_development_book_published/c0kbwlo)
put it very well, so I'll just quote him:

What does Grok the caveman himself have to say about a book on Grok? Or
about any book, even, as he can't tell the difference?

Um, sorry about that. I think we should let more literate people review
the book instead.
