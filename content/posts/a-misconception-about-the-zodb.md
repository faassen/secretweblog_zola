The ZODB is a powerful object database for Python objects. It's very
mature - it's been around for more than a decade. It is transactional,
has advanced features like clustering (ZEO), blob support, and yes, it
can be used independently from Zope. Zope 2, Zope 3 and Grok all use the
ZODB as its default data storage, and it's seen a lot of battle testing.

As a result of various discussions in the past, I realized that some
smart, informed people, seem to think the ZODB doesn't do what it
actually does. The ZODB is _really_ an object database. It really does
get references between objects right. It's not an object store where
references have to be indirect (a string, for instance). Somehow this
misconception about the ZODB is widespread.

What do I mean when I say the ZODB "gets references right"? Let me give
you an example with a lot of a, b and c. If you have object `a` that
points to `c`, and object
<span class="title-ref">b</span><span class="title-ref"> that also
points to
</span><span class="title-ref">c</span><span class="title-ref">,
updating </span><span class="title-ref">c</span><span class="title-ref">
will really matter to both
</span><span class="title-ref">a</span><span class="title-ref"> and
</span><span class="title-ref">b</span><span class="title-ref">. You
will reach the updated version of
</span><span class="title-ref">c</span><span class="title-ref"> through
the reference in both
</span><span class="title-ref">a</span><span class="title-ref"> and
</span><span class="title-ref">b</span>\`.

That kind of example sounds rather abstract, so here is some code that
demonstrates it:

    from persistent import Persistent

    class Source(Persistent):
      def __init__(self, ref):
          self.ref = ref

    class Target(Persistent):
       def __init__(self, message):
           self.message = message

Let's use this code:

    >>> c = Target("First message")
    >>> c.message
    'First message'
    >>> a = Source(c)
    >>> b = Source(c)
    >>> c.message = "Second message"
    >>> a.ref.message
    'Second message'
    >>> b.ref.message
    'Second message'

So what's special here? There's _nothing_ special! All this is the way
you'd expect it from Python. The ZODB's mission is to take normal Python
objects and persist them. This means that when you restart the
application, all your objects and the reference between them will still
be there. There are a few extra requirements to make sure objects get
persisted which I'll go into below, but in essence, the above example is
complete.

Quite a few smart people seem to be under the impression the ZODB does
far less than this. They believe references like this won't work
properly in the ZODB. They believe, perhaps, that `c` will be persisted
twice, once for `a`, once for `b`. This may be the case if `c` doesn't
inherit from the special `Persistent` superclass, but if it does, there
really will only be that instance.

The ZODB offers _transparent_ object persistence. It's almost exactly
like a pool of normal Python objects. They can reference each other just
fine. The only requirements I know of are:

- if you don't inherit your class from `Persistent`, or use a python
  builtin (which doesn't inherit from `Persistent`), instances of that
  class _can_ be serialized multiple times.
- if you want to persist your object, your object needs to be connected
  to another persistent object (such as the database root dictionary).
- since the ZODB is a transactional storage, you need to actually commit
  the transaction sometimes to make sure your changes are stored.
- if you have a non-Persistent subobject (like a list) and you change
  it, you need to manually flag the persistence machinery on the object
  that its subobject changed, with `_p_changed`. This is _only_
  necessary if some of the objects are not sublclasses of `Persistent`.
  For common built-in collections in Python such as list and dictionary
  there are replacements (`PersistentList`, `PersistentMapping`), and
  more advanced building blocks for indexes (BTrees), that don't have
  this issue.

The misapprehension that the ZODB somehow does less than it really does
seems to be an easy one for people to develop. One reason is because in
real-world Zope or Grok-based applications hard references like this are
relatively rare. The reason people don't use hard references like this
all the time in an application is that sometimes you want back
references, and sometimes you want looser coupling between objects. So
that's when things are referenced by a string or using some other form
of lookup.

It's no different in Python programs, though. For the same reason, you
sometimes put Python objects in a dictionary and look them up with a
key. The wide application of such soft references seems to give people
the impression that normal Python references somehow don't work.

Let's look at a complete example now. The only thing you need installed
to make this work is `ZODB3`, which you can retrieve from the Python
package index [here](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZODB3). It demonstrates
some of the details, such as how to set up a database and how to use the
root dictionary:

    from ZODB import FileStorage, DB
    from persistent import Persistent
    import transaction

    class Source(Persistent):
      def __init__(self, ref):
          self.ref = ref

    class Target(Persistent):
       def __init__(self, message):
         self.message = message

    def getroot():
        # open the database
        storage = FileStorage.FileStorage('/tmp/mystorage.fs')
        db = DB(storage)
        conn = db.open()
        dbroot = conn.root()
        return dbroot

    def main():
        dbroot = getroot()

        if 'a' not in dbroot:
            print "Filling database"
            fill_database(dbroot)
        else:
            print "Reusing existing database"
            # reset to first message
            dbroot['c'].message = 'First message'

        a = dbroot['a']
        b = dbroot['b']
        c = dbroot['c']

        print "message through a:", a.ref.message
        print "message through b:", b.ref.message
        print "ref is the same:", a.ref is b.ref
        print "ref is indeed c:", a.ref is c
        print "changing message c to: Second message"
        c.message = 'Second message'
        print "message through a:", a.ref.message
        print "message through b:", b.ref.message

        # commit any changes to the database
        transaction.commit()

    def fill_database(dbroot):
        dbroot['c'] = c = Target('First message')
        dbroot['a'] = a = Source(c)
        dbroot['b'] = b = Source(c)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

How could we do something about such misapprehensions? It would be good
if the ZODB had a single, up to date to date web site that people could
go to learn more about it. The ZODB is one of the coolest, most powerful
libraries in the Python world, but it's less well known than it should
be. I believe a good ZODB site, with some examples like the one above,
would also help grow the ZODB community. The ZODB community is currently
in a healthy enough state, with new developments always in progress, but
it's a shame more people aren't aware of it.

Unfortunately the ZODB developers themselves seem to be too busy to put
up this web site. It wouldn't be much work as it's mostly a matter of
collecting existing information and redacting it. So, I hope that they
will actually do it soon, so that I have some good hyperlinks to put at
the end of this article. This [wiki
page](http://wiki.zope.org/ZODB/FrontPage) seems inadequate, but it's
what Google thinks is the most relevant when I search for "ZODB".

The [ZODB PDF file](http://svn.zope.org/ZODB/trunk/doc/zodb.pdf) is very
useful, though I wish I knew of a better way to link to it than to the
Subversion repository.

A recent [good
introduction](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-zodb/)
was created by Brandon Rhodes and Noah Gift for IBM developerworks.
