I've spent a bit of time writing the somewhat grandiosely titled [A
Review of the Web](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web.html),
and I think it's a neat addition to the documentation of the
[Morepath](http://morepath.readthedocs.org) web framework.

It attempts to do two things:

- Help those developers who aren't as familiar yet with the details of
  web technology to get a handle on various concepts surrounding web
  frameworks and web services.
- Show to developers who *are* more familiar with these concepts how
  Morepath fits in as a web framework.

Does this document fulfill either purpose? Let me know!
