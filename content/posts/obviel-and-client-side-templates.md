Armin Ronacher just wrote an [interesting blog
post](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/11/15/modern-web-applications-are-here/).

[Obviel](http://obviel.org) is a JavaScript based glue toolkit that lets
you assemble web applications on the client side. It integrates with
client-side template languages; by default, Obviel works with
[JSON-template](http://json-template.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Introducing-JSON-Template.html),
which also has server-side implementations (in Python and other
languages). Obviel is one approach to do some of what Armin is talking
about. I've used Obviel to build a number of web applications already,
and am looking for more to work on.

Last time I spoke about Obviel on this blog it didn't have any live
demos. Now it has a [few](http://www.obviel.org/en/0.-0/demo.html).
We're working on more.
