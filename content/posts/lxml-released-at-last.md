# lxml released at last

I've finally found the time to release lxml. So here then is
[lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml), release 0.5!

**The very brief lxml FAQ**

Q: What is lxml?

A: It's a Pythonic wrapping for libxml2 and libxslt

Q: What does that do?

A: It does XML, parsing it, writing it, manipulating it, searching in it
(XPath), transforming it (XSLT), and validating it (Relax NG), plus
more.

Q: But doesn't libxml2 already have a Python wrapper?

A: Yeah, but it's not pythonic at all. It's huge and difficult to
comprehend, it's low level, you can get segfaults and you have to do
your own memory management.

Q: Why isn't this in the Python package index?

A: I forgot my password, and resetting my password doesn't appear to
work correctly. The error already turned out to be reported in the PyPI
issue tracker on sourceforge.
