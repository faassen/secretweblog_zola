# Zope Foundation accepted in the Summer of Code

The Zope Foundation is happy to announce it was accepted in Google's
Summer of Code program in 2008!

Students interested in a Zope (or Grok) related project, please sign up
to our summer of code mailing list and introduce yourself and the
projects you're interested in. We only have a few days to hash them out
before Google starts accepting student applications:

Mentors, I hope you all already on that mailing list.
