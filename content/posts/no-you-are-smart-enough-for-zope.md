# No, you are smart enough for Zope

This [blog
entry](http://wyattbaldwin.com/2008/04/04/ruby-on-rails-revisited/) on
picking web frameworks is quite interesting. It doesn't give a lot of
detail, and it acknowledges this, but it does show the struggles someone
goes through trying to pick the right framework for the job (and one
that fits his mind). Wyatt Baldwin considered, among other frameworks,
Zope, and had the following to say:

> I was having a hard time with the Pylons docs, and so I ended screwing

> took a look at the Zope 3 site. I’m sure Zope is really awesome or
> whatever, but it might as well suck. Every time I look at that site,
> I’m just like “WTF! This shit has been around for like five years!”

It's very polite to say that the problem is that he's not smart enough
for Zope, but of course that's not true. It's *Zope*'s problem. If you
cannot learn Zope while you can learn so many other technologies, that's
a failure of the Zope community. *My* community.

Some in our community, including myself, are very much concerned with
this problem. I believe in fact there is universal acknowledgment within
the Zope community that this is a problem, but acknowledging a problem
is one thing, fixing the problem is another. The process to fix this
takes a while. There are multiple paths we've been taking:

- Grok: making Zope 3 more approachable. Grok attempts to make Zope 3
  more easy to use and more easy to explain, and then tries to explain
  it. Even though Grok wasn't the final choice of this developer, Grok
  actually comes out not too badly in this blog entry! I think we've
  been doing a good job so far, but there's a lot more to do. Come join
  us and help us if you're interested.
- Finally fix our Zope web presence. This has been something we
  should've fixed *years* ago, but progress has been very slow. It's
  easy to get a bunch of web developers to debate what technology they
  should be using for a web site. It's also fairly easy to get some nice
  layouts for your website. It's *hard* to get good content written.
  When you ask for that, you tend to hear crickets all of a sudden. That
  said, in the background we are making real progress.

Zope has a community that's very much alive. We have much that is good.
Our community is about 10 years old now. I've known quite a few of our
community members for almost that long by now, and am happy to count
them among my friends. We have a Zope Foundation, we have an industry
partner network, we have a lot of sprints
([Grokkerdam](http://wiki.zope.org/grok/GrokkerdamSprint) coming up
soon!), we have regional user group meetings, including a big one every
year in Germany, a significant presence at EuroPython, and we're active
in the Google Summer of Code. I also feel comfortable in claiming the
Plone community (including its own Plone Foundation) and the wildly
successful Plone conferences as a very important part of the wider Zope
community.

I think our community would've been even *more* vibrant if we paid more
attention to attracting newcomers to Zope technologies. Plone in
particular *has* been doing pretty well in attracting newcomers. We can
learn from them, and from the other communities around web frameworks.

I believe passionately in this mission of attracting people to our
platform, and thus I'm part of the Zope Foundation board (chairman, in
fact), helping to shepherd our participation in the Summer of Code, and
am part of the group of people who've started Grok. I'm excited about
the potential of Zope technologies. We may have been negligent to
attract newcomers, but we haven't been negligent otherwise: we've
continued to build powerful and great tools. We're sitting on an a lot
of amazing capabilities, and we need to make them more easy to use and
let people know about them (the mission of Grok).

I see a lot of hopeful signs. I believe we've seen Zope turn a corner in
the last year or so in the nature of perception in the wider Python
community. People are talking about Zope technologies again. But we can
do much, much more. Perhaps if we had done so earlier, Wyatt Baldwin and
many others would be part of our community now, contributing, instead of
moving on to another one.
