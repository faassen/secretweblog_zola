# Five 1.0 released!

Yesterday I've released the one dot oh version of
[Five](http://codespeak.net/z3/five), the Zope 2 product that allows you
to use Zope 3 technology in Zope 2, today.

This release has been the effort of a bunch of very smart developers
from all over. I think it's great that in about a year's time, it turned
from a few experiments of mine into a truly open source, multi-person
project with huge contributions from many others. Check out the
CREDITS.txt in the Five distribution to see a list of the people who
contributed, and sorry if I forgot anyone!

What's more, Five 1.0 is also the version that is going to be folded
into Zope 2.8. Zope 2.8 will be shipping with Five technology out of the
box! It is my hope that Five will become an important drive for further
Zope 2 evolution, throughout Zope 2.9 and onwards.

Meanwhile, Five development post-1.0 is going full-speed ahead. Philipp
von Weitershausen has been refactoring the Five package structure on a
branch, to make it more maintainable, and he, Lennart Regebro and
Florent Guillaume have been working on a version of Five that enables
one to use the Zope 3 i18n infrastructure inside Zope 2. This is
something I'd like to use for
[Silva](http://www.infrae.com/products/silva) eventually.
