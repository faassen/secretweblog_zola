# Balancing stability and innovation in open source

A good open source community should have a good developer and user
**support infrastructure**. It should have things such as:

- **releases** that are recent enough to be useful
- up to date and helpful **documentation**
- a good **web site**
- a helpful and active **mailing list**
- automated **tests**
- well maintained **change notes**
- well managed **issue tracker**
- well managed **version control system**

and so on. These are very important. Most open source communities
probably feel they can do a lot better in some of the areas above.

All that is necessary and important, but it isn't *enough*.

A living, functional open source community should also have **vision**.
It should support an **atmosphere of ideas**. Not just small ideas, but
also some bigger ideas, that affect the very core of the project and
everyone that uses it.

A community shouldn't only be in maintenance mode with improvements
taking place in the periphery, or only in matters where consensus can
easily be reached. A community should also be able to innovate in areas
where consensus is *difficult*, because sometimes that is necessary in
order to move forward.

Innovation is much easier in a smaller, younger community. In a larger,
more mature community it is easy to forget about innovation because
there is so much more focus on maintenance and stability. In such a
community, innovations will need to be more incremental in order to
safeguard stability. Incremental improvements can add up, however -
**evolution** can be very innovative. A living, functional community can
aim improvements in directions where they *do* add up.

A innovative community should have the following qualities:

- **creative energy**. There should be people who come up with ideas,
  preferably based on experience. There should be people who are not
  satisfied with the status quo and are willing to do something about
  it. These ideas shouldn't be just be in the periphery but also about
  core aspects of the project.
- **supportive atmosphere**: Creative energy should be channeled
  positively, not dispersed. A community should have an atmosphere where
  new ideas can be discussed and not just always be rejected or worse,
  ignored. Discussions should aim to refine ideas or offer alternative
  approaches.
- **process**: The community should have clear mechanisms in place that
  can help lead a discussion to a conclusion that can be accepted by the
  community.
- **leadership**: A process is important but not sufficient. In order to
  make the process work, the community should have people who are able
  to lead the process to **conclusions**.
- **implementers**: people who actually go and implement the idea.
  Without them, it all stays with a discussion and the community is
  ultimately inert.

A living open source community shouldn't discourage fundamental
innovations because the support infrastructure isn't right yet. It will
never be perfect - this is another way in which perfection can be the
enemy of the good. The community should support improvements to the
support infrastructure *and* allow innovation at the same time. A great
quality of open source communities is that **people can work in
parallel**.

It is often possible to **do both at the same time**: innovate and as a
side effect also improve the support infrastructure of the project, such
as documentation. The community should have a culture where innovations
go hand in hand with improvements to the support infrastructure that
this innovation touches, such as documentation.

To conclude: in open source communities, **a healthy balance between
stability and innovation needs to be maintained**. We should not lose
sight of one by focusing too much on the other.

**P.S.** I just realized that it is possible to interpret this post as
an argument against Python's [PEP
3003](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3003/), the "Python Language
Moratorium". It wasn't intended as such; I'm very much in favor of this
moratorium. The Python development community is a mature community where
innovation on the language level has certainly not been lacking. The
moratorium on language changes helps in the important area of stability,
and also helps refocus innovation on areas that do need improvement
more, such as the interpreter, libraries and the packaging
infrastructure.
