Long time no blog. I've been at Pycon and EuroPython since then (which
both were great experiences!). At EuroPython I gave a talk titled
"Things I helped create". I've just uploaded the slides for this in the
upload area of the EuroPython wiki:

<http://wiki.europython.eu/TalkMaterials?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=creation.odp>

I was overly ambitious in the amount of material I should be able to
present in an hour, so the talk ends somewhat abruptly and doesn't cover
quite a few other things I worked on. I hope to rework some of that
material for another talk in the future.
