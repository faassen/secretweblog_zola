I've just released a whole slew things of things, the most important is
[Morepath](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) 0.5, your
friendly neighborhood Python web framework with
[superpowers](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/superpowers.html)!

# What's new?

There are a a bunch of new things in the documentation, in particular:

- [How to use more.static for static resource
  inclusion](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/more.static.html)
- [How to use the with statement to be more succinct when declaring
  views](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/views.html#grouping-views)

Also available is `@reg.classgeneric`. This depends on a new feature in
the [Reg](http://reg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) library.

There are a few bug fixes as well.

For more details, see the full
[changelog](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/0.5.1/changes.html).

# Morepath mailing list

I've documented how to get in touch with the Morepath
[community](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/community.html).
In particular, there's a new Morepath mailing list!

Please do get in touch!

# Other releases

I've also released:

- [Reg 0.8](http://reg.readthedocs.org/en/latest). This is the generic
  function library behind some of Morepath's flexibility and power.
- [BowerStatic 0.3](http://bowerstatic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). This
  is a WSGI framework for including static resources in HTML pages
  automatically, using components installed with
  [Bower](http://bower.io/).
- [more.static 0.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.static). This is a
  little library integrating BowerStatic with Morepath.

# Morepath videos!

You may have noticed I linked to Morepath 0.5.1 before, not Morepath
0.5. This is because I had to as I was using a new youtube extension
that gave me a bit too much on readthedocs. I replaced that with raw
HTML, which works better. The Morepath docs now include two videos.

- On the [homepage](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is my
  talk about Morepath at EuroPython 2014 in July. It's a relatively
  short talk, and gives a good idea on what makes Morepath different.
- If you're interested in the genesis and history behind Morepath, and
  general ideas on what it means to be a creative developer, you can
  find another, longer, video on the Morepath [history
  page](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/history.html). This
  was taken last year at PyCon DE, where I had the privilege to be
  invited to give a keynote speech.
