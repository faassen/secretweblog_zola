# Summer of Code for Zope

Last year the Zope Foundation participated in the Google Summer of Code.
We had four students, all of whom are still active in the Zope
community, so we can declare this a success. We hope to participate in
2008 again, and we're looking for mentors and project ideas.

We need to show a list of mentors to Google soon, and the bigger that
list the better, so if you do want to mentor, please sign up here:

Being a mentor can be very rewarding, but it does require regular
contact with your student and with the mentor coordinator (myself).

We really hope to be able to participate in the Google Summer of Code
again this year! Project ideas are very welcome. We're looking for ideas
surrounding Zope 2, Zope 3 and the ZODB. I've already supplied a lot of
ideas that surround [Grok](http://grok.zope.org), but more ideas of
course wouldn't hurt.

By the way, Plone is also participating (they're an old hat at this by
now), so if your project is more Plone related, see
[here](http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-summer-of-code-2008/project-home).
